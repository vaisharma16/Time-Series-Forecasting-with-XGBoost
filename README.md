# Time Series Forecasting with XGBoost

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates time series forecasting using XGBoost, a powerful machine learning algorithm known for its efficiency and accuracy, especially in tabular data. The project is divided into two parts:

- Part 1: Introduction to time series forecasting with XGBoost, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
- Part 2: Outlier analysis, time series cross-validation, and advanced forecasting techniques.

## Part 1: Time Series Forecasting with XGBoost
This part covers the basics of time series forecasting using historical data, with the following key concepts:

- Feature Engineering: Creating features from the time series index (e.g., hour, day of the week) to enhance model performance.
- Modeling: Using XGBoost to handle tabular time series data.
- Feature Importance: Understanding the contribution of each feature to the model's performance.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model with Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
## Techniques:
- Robust cross-validation for time series data.
- Addition of external features (e.g., weather forecast, holidays) to improve prediction accuracy.
- Parameter tuning to optimize model performance.

## Part 2: Advanced Time Series Forecasting Techniques
In this part, more advanced topics are covered to improve the time series forecasting model:

- Outlier Analysis: Identifying and removing outliers to increase model accuracy.
- Lag Features: Creating lag features that provide historical context for the model.
- Forecasting Horizon: Determining the appropriate forecasting window for future predictions.
- Time Series Cross-Validation: Implementing time series-specific cross-validation techniques to prevent data leakage and improve generalization.
- Model Training: Training the model on the entire dataset after cross-validation.
- Saving and Loading Models: Efficiently saving and reloading trained XGBoost models in JSON format to avoid retraining.

## Installation
Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- XGBoost
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Usage
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the time series data to ensure it is suitable for forecasting.
- Feature Creation: Generate lag features, time-based features (hour, day of the week), and any relevant external features.
- Model Training: Train the XGBoost model using historical data.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model using RMSE.
- Outlier Analysis: Identify and handle outliers in the data.
- Time Series Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation to evaluate the model performance.
- Prediction: Use the trained model to predict future values.
- Model Saving and Loading: Save the trained model for future use and reload it to make additional predictions without retraining.
- Results: 
The XGBoost model performed well on time series forecasting tasks, with the RMSE metric indicating the accuracy of the predictions.
- Future Improvements
1. Addition of external features such as weather data or holiday schedules.
2.  Hyperparameter optimization for better model performance.
